# Movie-Recommendation
Design a model which will able to recommend genres of movies and choice actors based on users previously searched and watch movies
Four methods have been adopted in recommending movies which are Content-based Filtering,Collaborative Filtering, User-based Collaborative Filtering, and Item based Collaborative Filtering.
**Content-based Filtering**- Recommends movies based on a user's past seen movies, ratings and reviews.
**Collaborative Filtering**- Matches customers who watched similar movies.
**User-based Collaborative Filtering**- This algorithm first finds the similarity score between users. Based on this similarity score, it then picks out the most similar users and recommends movies which these similar users have seen previously.
**Item based collaborative filtering**- It looks for movies that are similar to the movies that user has already rated and recommend most similar movies.
